# Pre-trained Model (Transfer Learning)

This repository contains a detailed implementation of **transfer learning** using pre-trained deep learning models.  
It aims to provide an intuitive understanding of how existing powerful models can be fine-tuned for new tasks.  
The code uses **Python** and **PyTorch** (or **TensorFlow**, depending on your setup) while focusing on the key concepts behind transfer learning.

## Features

- **Pre-trained Models**: Usage of popular architectures like ResNet, VGG, etc.
- **Fine-tuning**: Modify and retrain specific layers for a new dataset.
- **Efficient Training**: Leverage learned features to achieve high accuracy with less data and time.
- **Visualization**: Optional visualization of predictions and model behavior.

## Requirements

To run the code in this project, you need:

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch or TensorFlow (as used in the notebook)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Overview

The notebook includes:

- **Introduction to Transfer Learning**: Brief explanation of the concept and when to use it.
- **Loading Pre-trained Models**: How to load architectures like ResNet, VGG, etc.
- **Customizing the Model**: Freezing/unfreezing layers and modifying output layers.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Training the customized model on a new dataset and evaluating its performance.
- **Result Visualization**: (Optional) Plotting predictions to visually inspect model accuracy.
